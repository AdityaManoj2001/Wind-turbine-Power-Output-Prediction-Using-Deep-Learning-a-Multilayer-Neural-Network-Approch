## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **Deep Learning** models built using **PyTorch** and **TensorFlow** to predict
wind turbine power output based on SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) data. The models use real-time
features such as wind speed, theoretical power curve, and wind direction to estimate the power output.


## Objectives
1. Build a neural network model using both PyTorch and TensorFlow.
2. Train the models to predict the power output (`LV ActivePower (kW)`).
3. Evaluate the models' performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
4. Generate continuous predictions.


## Data Preprocessing
The dataset used contains features like:
Wind Speed (m/s)
Theoretical Power Curve (KWh)
Wind Direction (Â°)**
LV ActivePower (kW) (Target)


## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how to use TensorFlow to predict wind turbine power output based
on real-world SCADA data. Both models perform similarly in terms of MAE, and continuous real-time predictions are
generated efficiently.
